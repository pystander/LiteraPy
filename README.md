# LiteraPy

``LiteraPy`` is a pure-Python program dedicated for autofilling Chinese vocabularies and phrases. It is particularly designed to assist students and writers in their writings with matched, suitable word choice.

Please note that this is only my own practice for Python learning as a IT student, and should not be taken as a high-end solution.
