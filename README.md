# LiteraPy

``LiteraPy`` is a pure-Python program dedicated for autofilling Chinese vocabularies and phrases. It is particularly designed to assist students and writers in their writings with matched, suitable word choice.

Please note that this is only my own practice on Python as a CS student. The program is still under development and should never be taken as a high-end solution.
