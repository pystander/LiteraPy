# LiteraPy

``LiteraPy`` is a pure-Python program dedicated for autofilling Chinese vocabularies and phrases. It is particularly designed to assist students and writers in their writings with matched, suitable word choice.

Please note that this is only my own practice on Python as an IT student, and this should never be taken as a high-end solution.
For further enquiries, please feel free to contact me on GitHub via [Issues](https://github.com/pystander/LiteraPy/issues).
